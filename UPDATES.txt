***Things that need to be implemented***

Need to add an "Add Transaction" icon like a plus or something on the dashboard, keep in mind modern design trends. 
Real-Time Feedback: Provide immediate feedback on user actions (e.g., loading indicators, success messages).
Dynamic Charts: Enhance charts with interactivity (e.g., tooltips, clickable segments) using Chart.js features.
Category Trends: Analyze spending trends over time within each category.
Scrolling animation: make things dynamically load when scrolling (except the main 3 cards: total income, total expenses and balance)
Toast Notifications: Enhance the showToast function to manage multiple toasts gracefully and prevent clutter.
