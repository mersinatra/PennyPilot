i want the cards on the dashboard to slightly enlarge when hovered over for a better user experience.
i also want an intuitive "Add Transaction" icon like a plus or something on the dashboard (maybe even replace Add Transaction from the nav menu with Transactions - which shows detailed summaries transactions as well options to Add/remove/edit transactions. make add_transactions.html a pop up window instead of opening a whole new page)
make the expenses by category section smaller (the graph thingy is huge and takes up the entire page and then some.)
